I started by applying the easiest changes I knew how to make to the page based on the screenshot, such as changing the font to a sans-serif typeface, adjusting the header background colors, adding extra margin on the left for the body, and capitalizing headers. From here, I worked from the top to the bottom of the screenshot, starting with targeting the underlined subtitle, reducing leading, changing text colors, and reverting some capitalized text from the previous step to be capitalized again. I relied mainly on external CSS, since I like keeping HTML and styling separate, adding IDs and classes to HTML tags when necessary. 

Once I reached the Octopus quiz section, I struggled to figure out how to format the information to match the screenshot. I attempted to use a flex display and changed the image order by adding an id to target, but I couldn't align the image to the left and center it vertically while keeping the header and form content in the same row. Then I switched my approach to using a table, and this is where I found more success. I still struggled at the beginning because I put the header and the form in one row, so the text would overlap, but ultimately I put them on separate rows with the image spanning both.

After that, I went back and did minor edits, like making the "External Resources" and "Comparison with Other Cephalopods" headings the same size, and adjusted the padding/margins to look more like the screenshot.
